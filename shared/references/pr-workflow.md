# PR Workflow

**All changes flow through PRs. PRs are the project's task board.**

- **Scope first.** Before writing code, state: (a) branch name, (b) PR title, (c) 1-3 bullet scope. If unclear, scope isn't ready
- **One PR = one logical change.** If implementation outgrows description, stop and split
- **Never commit directly to main/master.** Branch protection enforces this
- **Never use `--admin` to bypass CI.** Wait for checks
- **Draft PRs for exploration.** Convert to ready when scope is clear
- **Write a trajectory note before opening the PR**, at `<repo>/documentation/trajectories/YYYY-MM-DD-PR<N>.md`. Use the schema in OverSteward `documentation/trajectories/TEMPLATE.md`. Captures what worked, what didn't, and what was learned — input artifact for the review-fork subagent (Fiscus epic #25).
- **Branch naming:** `feat/short-description`, `fix/short-description`, `docs/short-description`
- `gh pr list` replaces checking todo files for project status
